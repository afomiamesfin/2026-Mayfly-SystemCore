When you want to make a new auto:

1. Set up the paths you need in Choreo (the application)
    - Make sure to follow the naming convention
2. List any new paths in @ChorPaths.java
3. List the auto as an enum identifier in @Autos.java
4. Create the method in @AutoFactory.java
    - returns a Pair of your initial pose (Pose2d) & what happens in your auto (Command)
    - use existing createAuto() methods as an example!
5. Add an @AutoProgram at the top of @AutoChooser.java, in the List
    - param1: Auto.java enum classifier
    - param2: String name
    - param3: supply @AutoFactory method
6. Yay, now you've made a full auto!
